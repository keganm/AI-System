# AI-System

Initial Creation of an AI System in Unity.
AI units Have basic needs that drain overtime.

Resources are placed in the scene.
AI will slowly explore more and more of the environment.
When resource is needed they will go to the nearest available resource that they have passed through,
or a resource that they have visual contact with.

One need is companionship which is available from other AI, and will not be remembered.

Personalities of AI entities change when near other AI based partially on the current AIs Age and Identity
Change will also be determined by the compatability between the two interacting AI.

Future Implementations:
Modify the movement mechanism to increase natural movement.
Create personality characteristics and modify AI interactions based on that.

(Will update with more information later)
