# AI-System
Refer to AITest.mov for an example of behavior

Initial Creation of an AI System in Unity.
AI units Have basic needs that drain overtime.

Resources are placed in the scene.
AI will slowly explore more and more of the environment.
When resource is needed they will go to the nearest available resource that they have passed through,
or a resource that they have visual contact with.

One need is companionship which is available from other AI, and will not be remembered.

Personalities of AI entities change when near other AI based partially on the current AIs Age and Identity
Change will also be determined by the compatability between the two interacting AI.

Personality between AI now modifies movement behavior (pull an push influenced by the need of the entity)

Todo:
Modify the movement mechanism to increase natural movement. (Priority) 
Further the dynamics of the personality behavior (Attack other AI, take ownership of areas?)
Bypass or modify navigation so more predictive behaviors can be implemented 
Must maintain high efficiency (Behavioral LOD or culling?)

(Will update with more information later)
